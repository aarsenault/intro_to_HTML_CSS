# Intro to HTML and CSS:


The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to the core fundamentals of web development. This course is only one hour long so we won't be able to cover everything, but wherever possible I'm going to try and add as many extra resources for you all to continue your learning after this course is over. 

with the fundamentals you learn here today, you should all be able to make simple web projects, or make a homepage to showcase your project and / or team. 


## Getting Started

Web programmers usually code in something called a text editor. If you already have a text editor installed please use that for this lecture.

If you don't have one yet, to save time, you can follow along using [jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output) which will let you code online. Make an account when you're finished to save your project. 

While you make your hackathon project, I recommend that you use a real text editor and not jsbin. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free and open sourced. Other popular choices are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/). If you're not sure which to use just go ahead and download VS Code - you can always change later. 


## What Is A Webpage

I think most people have a good understanding of what a webpage is. It's a page that's accessible at some address (or URL) i.e. `www.google.com` that you view through a special program called a web browser (i.e Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc.) 


But what goes into a webpage? What makes it different than a word document, or a pdf?

If you have clicked the link for [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output) you'll see three panels - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a good clue as to what makes up a web


## HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's not strictly a programming language, but more of a way to structure text and information on a page.
